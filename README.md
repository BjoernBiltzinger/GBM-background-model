# GBM-background-model
A physically motivated background model for the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board of the Fermi satellite.
 
This model has the potential to significantly improve the scientific output of Fermi/GBM, 
as it can be used to improve the background estimation for spectral analysis and localization of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). 
Additionally it can also lead to new detections of transient events, because transient events, that due to their weak or slow rising signals
do not activate one of the existing trigger algorithms, can be extracted with a good physically motivated background model.
