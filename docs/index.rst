Welcome to gbmbkgpy's documentation!
====================================

`gbmbkgpy` is a simulation and fitting software for the time-dependent background seen by Fermi/GBM. Due to an extensive rewrite it's current state is **unstable**.
All the core functionality should be restored, but in case you encounter bugs or weird results please report them on `GitHub <https://github.com/BjoernBiltzinger/GBM-background-model/issues/>`__.

The rewrite made the code way more general and allows its core to be also used with other experiments.
